                        <p class="top projText textLt0">Greg brings a passion for deep and crystal-clear understanding of complex problems, information, and context. Throughout his career, Greg has dived into ideas as tiny as packets (the TCP/IP kind) and as large as the health care system, tackling each with a zeal for crafting a complete information or solution picture. Greg believes sharing this passion with his DesignMap colleagues is the basis for design work that addresses both the domain and the range of a user interface problem.</p>
                        <p class="projText textLt0">Prior to joining DesignMap, Greg was a senior interaction designer at Dubberly Design Office where he tackled large and highly technical projects for Sun Microsystems and PacketMotion.</p>

He began his career at TS Design in Boston (now part of RazorFish), where he worked on interface and strategy solutions for Fortune 500 companies such as the 3M Company and Fleet Bank. He left TS Design to join America Online's west-coast design staff, where he was responsible for the design of community and communications services and applications for deployment on AOL's major brands. Gregory has BFA in Graphic Design from Rhode Island School of Design.</p>
