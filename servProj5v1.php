                        <p class="projText textLt0">Usability studies determine the "usability" of an existing product or site (in other words, can people accomplish what you hope they can accomplish, or does something need fixing); give a manager or an engineering team visibility into an issue at relatively low cost (for example, convince management that budget for a site redesign is warranted); or refine and course-correct the design process to ensure a well-designed product that helps users accomplish their goals.</p>
                        <p class="projText textLt0">Each circumstance requires very different settings and studies, and we modify our approach accordingly. We conduct usability research in formal labs, participant's workplaces or homes, client offices, or coffee shops. Studies may take several day-long marathons or be conducted weekly in smaller sessions.</p>
