                     <p class="projText nextPage">Cisco's Emerging Technologies Group (ETG) asks the question "Where is Cisco going?" and then turns the answers into real products. Run by some of Cisco's most experienced and talented employees, the group's role is to, "follow technology innovations to see how they might serve the company's needs." Cisco's commitments to the ETG, the talent they've placed there, and Cisco's unique ability to control the whole experience create some of today's most groundbreaking products, products that are responsible for real revenue to Cisco.</p>
                     <p class="projText nextPage">We've had the opportunity to work on several of Cisco's ETG projects, including Digital Media, a digital signage and desktop video solution, and TelePresence, an interaction and collaboration tool that uses life-sized, high definition video and audio.</p>

                     <p class="projText prevPage">In both cases, we were working with highly experienced groups who needed to work with designers that could quickly become part of the team, not taking over the project or starting from scratch, but quickly getting up to speed and pitching in exactly when and where they needed our help, from improving existing applications to high-level brainstorming and strategizing. We credit our continued involvement with these teams to our abilities to work well with engineering groups and to hit the ground running as real team players, regardless of the circumstances.</p>
