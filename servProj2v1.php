                        <p class="projText textLt0">We conduct audits for clients who want to understand the scope and importance of web site or application issues so they can decide whether to refresh, redesign, or start from scratch. We also conduct audits to help clients gather information on competitors. </p>
                        <p class="projText textLt0">First, we work with our clients to understand who is using their site or product, and why. We agree on a list of heuristics, or established usability standards, to use for the evaluation. Then we conduct our review and report our findings, along with detailed recommendations for improvement.</p>
                        <p class="projText textLt0">Our approach is relatively quick and inexpensive and offers specific and measurable improvements.</p>
