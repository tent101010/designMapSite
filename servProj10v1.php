We start these projects by uncovering and reviewing any existing research or related work. We also work to understand our client's individual challenges and learn about their internal clients.</p><p class="projText textLt0">Once we've digested what research in place and stakeholders' goals and priorities, we conduct our own research, as needed. That research might include reviews or audits of competitive products, interviews with or observation of potential users, and development of user personas. Then we may provide some diagramming or modeling, depending on the complexity of the problem and whether there are any internal inconsistencies about the product, the product domain, users, or their goals.</p></div>

Engineers are some of our most important clients, as we understand that the success of our design dependents on how successfully it can be implemented. We can deliver functional prototypes, guidelines and specifications, or front-end code to your engineering team, or whatever variation of those deliverables works best for them.</p><p class="projText textLt1 prevPage">Application design can take anywhere from four to fourteen weeks, depending on your requirements, how much research in necessary, and what your engineers need from us.</p></div>

Based on users' goals, we begin to write stories, or scenarios, about how the products will help users achieve their goals. Those stories quickly convert to storyboards and then maps of the application. Creating a product map early in the process helps management and engineering make sure the project is on track and the right size before applying too many resources.</p><p class="projText textRt0 nextPage">Once the scope of the project is well understood, we proceed with high-fidelity wireframes, visual design, and functional prototypes or proofs-of-concept, as needed. Any of these deliverables can be used for usability research to verify design direction, confirm assumptions, and address outstanding questions.</p></div>
