                         Amy started her career at KnowledgeWire, a web-based training startup, designing webpages. After a move to San Francisco, she worked as a web developer at Adjacency, bought by Sapient, building sites for clients like Nordstrom and Specialized. She then spent several years working for VIZ Media&mdash;a publisher of Japanese comics and animation&mdash;first as webmaster and then as a print designer. In 2008 she went back to graduate school to focus on interaction design. While there, she presented at UIST, SIGGRAPH and interned at Stamen Design.

                         Her career has involved everything from an Eisner award to accepting a lucite trophy from Robin Leech and her current obsessions include astronomical symbols, programming languages for non-programmers and unnecessarily extravagant print jobs. Amy has a BS in Biology from Trinity University and an MFA in Design from California College of the Arts.
