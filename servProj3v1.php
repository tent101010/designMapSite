                        <p class="projText textLt0">Often our clients have a hypothesis about who might use their product, why, and under what circumstances. They hire us to conduct the user research necessary to confirm those hypotheses. User research checks assumptions and points product management and design teams in directions that meet user or business needs. Up-front user research ensures a project is headed in the right direction before committing many resources.</p>
                        <p class="projText textLt0">We can also connect clients with partners that conduct quantitative or international research.</p>
                        <p class="projText textLt0">Once research is complete, we deliver all our materials (notes, videos, etc) along with recommendations. We like Jared Spool's distinction between "observation, inference, opinion, and recommendation," and are careful to keep those clear for our clients.</p>
