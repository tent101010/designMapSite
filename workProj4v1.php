                     <p class="projText">Renesas is one of the worldâ€™s leading microcontroller suppliers, with revenues of about 9 billion dollars, 26,500 employees, and a global network of manufacturing, design and sales operations in 20 countries. We were thrilled when Renesas approached us to redesign their entire web site, including U.S., Japanese and local sites.
</p> 
                     <p class="projText">Before starting on design, we reviewed the substantial analytics and usability research already collected on the site. We also met with stakeholders across the globe to understand the company's business needs and the unique requirements of individual regions.</p>
                     <p class="projText">Armed with our research, we began a rigorous design process to address stakeholders' varying needs, accommodate multiple languages and meet the business needs of the site's users. Our deliverables included designs for the English and Japanese sites as well as templates for localization in other locations.</p>
