                     <p class="projText nextPage">Model N is a software designer that offers revenue management, which they call, "An emerging enterprise application category that enables companies to align and improve the processes of pricing and quoting, contract development and management, trade settlements and channel incentives." Over the course of our relationship, we've done interaction design, visual design, specifications, and front-end development for Model N.</p>
                     <p class="projText nextPage">We were hired in 2002 by Model N's marketing team to polish their core application, which was mid-way through a migration to the web. Model N was also completing a brand redesign at the same time, providing an ideal opportunity to standardize customer facing products and communications.</p>

                     <p class="projText prevPage">Coming in to design a product already midway through development isn't ideal, but what excited us from the beginning about Model N is how excited they were about the improvements we could suggest to their product. They saw sufficient value in our recommendations to justify the additional development costs necessarily to implement nearly every one of them. </p>
                     <p class="projText prevPage">Our relationship has continued over the years; most recently we were brought in by the Vice President of Product Management, an old friend of ours from our first engagement with Model N, to extend their core product with new components. </p>
                     <p class="projText prevPage">We continue to think of Model N as one of our favorite clients, who value the kind of quality experience for their clients that professional design can provide, and who bring a great deal of insight to the design work itself.</p>
