                         Sarah has been obsessed with systems and interactions since elementary school, when she fell in love with maps, diagramming sentences, and chemistry experiments. She is a big believer in using narrative as a design tool, and has recently developed an abiding affection for color.

                         Before becoming an interaction designer, Sarah was a magazine writer, a pseudonymous memoir writer, an editor, a project manager, and sometime personal shopper. Since taking up interaction design a few years ago, she has done work for the Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Vogue.com, American Express, and LabCorp.

                          Sarah has a BA in Modern Culture and Media, with a focus on writing and literary theory. She attended Brown University and figures she must have passed Greg and Nathan on the hill at some point.
